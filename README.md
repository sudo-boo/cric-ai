# Cric-AI

All the visualisations that I used in this are mostly images that I provide along with explanation, code based visualisations. `generate-pitch-map.ipynb` attached along with the report.

Along with that, I used a Desmos simulation for the ball pitching and perspective analysis. Each ball can be roughly assumed to be a skewed sine line in 3D space. Thatâ€™s what I used to roughly simulate the environment. To check that live : [Click Here](https://www.desmos.com/3d/a951e169b8)

Do go through these visualisations and codes. The comparison of actual pitching in the simulation vs processed results using our approach is done in the end.
