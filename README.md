## Ultra-Edge

 **Objective** 

Noise Suppression: Use two microphones (one near the bat, one further away) to filter out crowd noise.
Frequency Analysis: Identify spikes in bat-ball strike frequency band gaps using a frequency spectrum tool.
Detect spikes in specific frequency ranges that indicate bat-ball strikes.

**Results**

## Pitch-Map

**Objective**

Determine pitch map of deliveries by just using the Umpire POV video feed

All the visualizations I used in this are mostly images that I provide along with explanations, and based visualizations. `generate-pitch-map.ipynb` is attached along with the report.

**Results**

I also used a Desmos simulation for the ball pitching and perspective analysis. Each ball can be roughly assumed to be a skewed sine line in 3D space. To check that live : [Click Here](https://www.desmos.com/3d/a951e169b8)
